# Sensemaking-Airflow-Docker-Dags
In this project, I pulled Data from MIT's course library. The data being pulled from the web is unstructured. This analysis will be saved as a JSON file, which will then be referenced by my D3 web application. Lastly, the web application will generate a visual analysis of the JSON data that I collected.

To streamline the data analysis process, I used software tools like Docker and Airflow.  I instantiating an Airflow web server within a Docker container to handle each Python task.
